.TH CYGFUSE 8 2022\-02\-26 3.2.0 "Cygwin interface to FUSE providers"

.SH NAME
\fBcygfuse\fR - Cygwin interface to Windows FUSE providers

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcygfuse\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a simple interface for user
programs to export a virtual filesystem to Cygwin. It also aims
to provide a secure method for non-privileged users to create
and mount their own filesystem implementations.
.PP
\fBCygfuse\fR supplies an emulation of Linux libfuse/libfuse3.
It allows FUSE clients such as sshfs, memfs, ftpfs, etc to
make use of certain FUSE providers implemented for Windows.
.PP
At this time WinFSP is the only Windows FUSE provider supported.
